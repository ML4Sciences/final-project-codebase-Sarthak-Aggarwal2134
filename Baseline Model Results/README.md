# Research Paper Results: ProSGNN - Predicting Effects of Mutations on Protein Stability using Graph Neural Networks
This document presents the results of the research paper titled "ProSGNN - Predicting Effects of Mutations on Protein Stability using Graph Neural Networks". The paper aimed to develop a model that can accurately predict the effect of mutations on protein stability using graph neural networks.

## Methodology
The authors used a graph neural network-based model called ProSGNN to predict the effect of mutations on protein stability. The model was trained on a dataset of 14,990 mutations in 4,923 protein structures, and its performance was evaluated using various metrics, including root mean squared error (RMSE) and Pearson correlation coefficient.

## Results
The authors reported that ProsGnn outperformed existing methods in predicting the effect of mutations on protein stability. The model achieved an RMSE of 0.94 and a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.62, indicating its high accuracy and robustness.

The authors also performed ablation experiments to evaluate the contribution of different components of the model to its performance. They found that the graph convolutional layers and the attention mechanism significantly contributed to the model's performance.

## Conclusion
The authors concluded that ProsGnn is a promising model for predicting the effect of mutations on protein stability. Its high accuracy and robustness can aid in drug design and protein engineering. They suggested that future research can explore its application in other protein-related tasks.
